Our mission is to provide an organization which will allow students the ability to establish a networking system. This network system will allow interaction between other students, as well as the College of Business Administration faculty and staff. Students will not only network within their select peers and faculty, but also have the opportunity to network with professionals within the business community.

The MIS Society will give its members the added tools and knowledge of the IT industry and the role that Management Information Systems plays in todayâ€™s business world. We will accomplish this by organizing events and seminars to help guide our members in career development and building a professional networking portfolio.
